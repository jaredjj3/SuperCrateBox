SuperCrateBox is a simple but addictive game where you can collect crates, dodge enemies, and save the world! Enemies spawn faster as the game progresses, but power-ups aid you in this struggle.

## Gameplay

SuperCrateBox starts with a crate and our hero, Jay.

Jay can move left, right, and double jump. Points are awarded when Jay picks up a <img src="./lib/img/crate.png"/>. Immediately after Jay picks up a <img src="./lib/img/crate.png"/>, another one will spawn in a random location.

### Enemies

Enemies, called Hammers, run around the map wreaking havoc to anything they touch... Except crates. Hammers that fall through the bottom of the map reappear at the top. As you collect more crates, more Hammers spawn.
